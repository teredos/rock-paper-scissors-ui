# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) project, written in JavaScript, as assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). This version of the game features a simple UI. You earn 1 point for every round won and the first player to reach 5 points wins the game!
